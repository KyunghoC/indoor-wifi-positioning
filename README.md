# Indoor Wi-Fi positioning
We suggest Wi-Fi positioning based on **Fingerprinting**
* Figerprinting - A unique characteristic of the radio signal (e.g. Identify a position based on a set of RSSIs associated with APs

### Goal
Develop Android application for indoor positioning (AI 공학과 4, 5층) using Wi-Fi and sensors

### Blueprint of AI 공학관
